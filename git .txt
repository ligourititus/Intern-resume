I have started my first intern and i have a report on Dark mode and Light mode usin Javascript.
In the begining i hava create resume using (html) and added style using css.
Then i have worked on javascript.
On that first i have created a toggle button.
Then i have added dark mode using background color to black.
After that for Light mode just default color (white).
This is how my Tasks are going on.
Next is to push my code on Git hub.
By using these commands {
    -git init(initilize my git )
    -git remote add orgin LINK(add repository link)
    -git add .
    -git commit -m ""(title)
    -git push -u orgin master/main(chose the branch)
}
